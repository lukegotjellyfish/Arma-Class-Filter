# Arma-Class-Parser
This was developed to use on RHS AFRF/USAF/GREF/SAF config files.

Script.py is broken in multiple ways.<br>

Class Searcher.py is also broken in multiple ways but much easier to fix - main issues are (fixable) compatability between mod configs and base-game configs alongside parsing vehicle classes.

VehicleExport.sqf in the Class Searcher folder is a continuation of what both python scripts served to do, using KillZone Kid's make_file_64x (v 1.5) to write data to a file.
