# Arma-Class-Parser
Script.py is broken in multiple ways.<br>

Class Searcher.py is also broken in multiple ways but much easier to fix - main issue seems to be (fixable) compatability between mod configs and base-game configs alongside parsing vehicle classes.

VehicleExport.sqf in the ClassSearcher folder is a continuation of what both python scripts served to do, using KillZone Kid's make_file_64x (v 1.5) to write data to a file.
